Players: (Inspired by Onefootball)
		Number of tackles per game and per season using events table (tackle) and player name (ex: Phil Jagaelka)		
		Number of fouls commited
		Number of Clearances
		Number of Blocks
		Number of Yellow/Red cards
		Number of own goals
		Number of fouls conceded
	      Number of Passes
		Number of Passes per 90'
            Pourcentage of successful passes
		Number of touches
		Number of goals
		Number of xG
		Minutes/goal
		Number of dribbles
		Number of shots
		Number of saves

Using these statistics, we will implement all sorts of Graphs comparing players (ex: barplot of the top scorers etc)
Our goal is to give the user the option to choose a team then choose a team and a match/season (nous allons créér une liste qui contient la liste des clubs et pour chaque club sa liste de joueurs), then search for every occurence of the player in the database and visualise every single statistic mentioned above.
We hope to mainly use the Players dataset.

Matches:
	per match: C:\Users\user\Downloads\Capture web_31-1-2023_151214_www.google.com
	
	per season:
		barplot of goals conceded/scored of every team
		plot of goals conceded/scored for one club
		barplot of Wins/Draws/Losses
		plot of Wins/Draws/Losses for one club
		League standings
		barplot of yellow & red cards
		pieplot of yellow & red cards
		plot of fouls conceded/won
		plot of shots, expected goals (xG) and goals scored
	
With the help of the Events folder, for one game, we use on file, for the season, we will use all files and calculate every stat.
